                            <p>The Digital SAT has been administered in Ghana since March 2023. The Digital SAT comprises of two sections. The first section is Reading & Writing. The second section is Math. The duration for the Digital SAT is 2 hours and 14 minutes and is scored on a scale of 400–1600. <br/></p>
                            <p>The Digital SAT Reading and Writing Section is two-stage adaptive test design with two separately timed modules. Each module has 25 operational questions and 2 pretest questions to be answered in 32 minutes. All questions are four-option multiple-choice given on short passages with stimulus topics from Literature, history/social studies, humanities, and science.  Questions on the Reading and Writing Section represent one of four content domains: Standard English Conventions (11-15 questions), Expression of Ideas (8-12 questions), Craft and Structure (13-15 questions), and Information and Ideas (12-14 questions). The Digital SAT Reading and Writing is scored on a scale of 200-800. <br/></p>
                            <p>The Digital SAT Math Section is also a two-stage adaptive test design with two separately timed modules. Each module has 20 operational questions and 2 pretest questions to be answered in 35 minutes. 75% of the questions are four-option multiple-choice and 25% are student-produced response questions.

                            <p>Students can take the digital SAT at a test center on a wide range of devices, including their own laptops (Windows or MacOS), iPads, school-owned desktops and laptops, and school-managed Chromebooks. Students taking the SAT on a weekend who do not have access to a device can request to borrow one from College Board, and we’ll provide one for use on test day. <br/></p>
                            <p>SAT scores act as a common point of reference and helps the admissions committee compare applicants applying for admissions and scholarships.
